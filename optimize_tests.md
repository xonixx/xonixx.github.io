# TODO

_March 2023_

## Problem description

In [CML Team](https://www.cmlteam.com) we are building our (yet internal) CRM system.
It's a traditional web application with Java + Spring Boot + MySQL on the backend and React + Next.js on the frontend.

We have pretty good code coverage for the backend (reaching 80%) with tests, but the integration tests are (as expected) rather slow. It takes 20+ minutes to run on CI server, and it's even slower running locally.

## Source of slowness

## The rewrite approach

## Why the new approach is better?
