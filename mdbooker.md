# mdbooker -- turn your README.md into a documentation site

_TODO 2024_

In this article I want to present you the tiny utility [mdbooker](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker). 

This allows me to convert my project's [README.md](https://github.com/xonixx/makesure) into a beautiful documentation site [makesure.dev](https://makesure.dev).

The utility works in conjunction with the amazing [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) tool.

## How it works

`mdBook` generates a documentation site (a "book") from a set of markdown files based on a [SUMMARY.md](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html).

Therefore, `mdbooker` splits your README.md into a set of markdown files (based on titles) and generates the SUMMARY.md.


## Usage

### Step 1: run mdbooker

```sh
REPO=username/reponame \
BOOK=path/to/book_folder \
  awk -f mdbooker.awk README.md
```

where

- `username/reponame` - the GitHub repository where README resides. This is needed to correctly rewrite relative links.
- `path/to/book_folder` (optional, default `./book`) - the output folder for generated markdown files.

### Step 2: run mdBook

```sh
mbdook build
```

### Step 3: deploy the website

The deployment of final html/js/css (as generated by the previous step) to the public web is out of scope of this article.

## Technical details

The project is implemented as a single-file [AWK script](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/main/mdbooker.awk) ([Wait... What?!](awk.md)).

This part can be of interest to those who would like to sharpen their AWK-fu a bit.

Before explaining some bits of my implementation let's come up with the requirements.

1. `SUMMARY.md` should be generated with a structure (nesting) determined by `## titles` in README.md.
2. README.md is split into separate .md-files named by titles.
3. Cross-README links are "fixed". In markdown you can reference any `## Section Title` by a `href="#section-title"`. This requires special handling. 
4. Relative links are "fixed". Since README.md resides in a repository it can reference any project file by its relative path. This requires special handling.
5. "Empty" sections should be filled by the list of links to their child sub-sections. This is needed when `## section` is immediately followed by `### sub-section` (So we want [this](https://makesure.dev/Directives.html) instead of [this](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_22.html)).   

Now let's take a look at how these requirements are implemented in code.
 
Let me remind you how in markdown the hierarchy of titles is defined:

| md          | html             |
|-------------|------------------|
| `# Title`   | `<h1>Title</h1>` |
| `## Title`  | `<h2>Title</h2>` |
| `### Title` | `<h3>Title</h3>` |
| etc.        |                  |
      
So to parse nesting you need to parse the number of `#`. How do you do it with AWK?

It appears, AWK's `match()` function can match a regex in a string and set `RSTART` and `RLENGTH` for you:

```
$ awk 'BEGIN { match("#####",/^#+/); print "RSTART="RSTART", RLENGTH="RLENGTH }'
RSTART=1, RLENGTH=5
```

This explains [this line](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L16). 

It's worth noting, that this implementation requires parsing (traversing) the input file README.md two times. 

- First pass [is done](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L16) via standard AWK's pattern matching syntax. This pass
  - [prepares the mapping for cross-README link](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L25) (requirement 3.)
  - [populates "empty" sections](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L27) (requirement 5.)
- Second pass [is invoked](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L45) in the `END {}` block. [Here](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L49) it explicitly traverses our file (`FILENAME` is a variable equal to the file passed to `awk` command, README.md in our case). This pass:
  - Uses data, collected in pass 1
  - [Collects content](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L63) for each section
  - [Fixes cross-links](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L54-L55) (requirement 3.)
  - [Fixes relative links](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L57-L61) (requirement 4.). Note, how file links `[title](link)` and image links `![title](link)` require different handling.
  - [Populates SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L37) (requirement 1.)
  - [Populates a separate .md-file per section](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L33-L34) (requirement 2.)

Couple more tricks. 

With awk you can easily apply the needed indentation using `printf`. This usage is common:

```
$ awk 'BEGIN { printf "%10s\n", "hello" }'
     hello
```
This is not that obvious:
```
$ awk 'BEGIN { N=10; printf "%" N "s\n", "hello" }'
     hello
```
But this gives you:
```
$ awk 'BEGIN { for (N=5;N<10;N++) printf "%" N "s\n", "hello" }'
hello
 hello
  hello
   hello
    hello
```

This explains the logic in [this line](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/5602b433bfc78d1404e9d610c150920a049e6eb8/mdbooker.awk#L37). It allows producing this structure:

I hope this information should be enough to explain the logic of my script.

  
## Alternatives

The only alternative I've found is [Docsify](https://colinhacks.com/essays/docs-the-smart-way) -- small JS lib that renders your README.md as a single-page website. I didn't like it, though, because such single-pages usually give poor user experience.
