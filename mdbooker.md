# mdbooker -- turn your README.md into a documentation site

_TODO 2024_

In this article I want to present you the tiny utility [mdbooker](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker). 

This allows me to convert my project's [README.md](https://github.com/xonixx/makesure) into a beautiful documentation site [makesure.dev](https://makesure.dev).

The utility works in conjunction with the amazing [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) tool.

## How it works

`mdBook` generates a documentation site (a "book") from a set of markdown files based on a [SUMMARY.md](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html).

Therefore, `mdbooker` splits your README.md into a set of markdown files (based on titles) and generates the SUMMARY.md.


## Usage

### Step 1: run mdbooker

```sh
REPO=username/reponame \
BOOK=path/to/book_folder \
  awk -f mdbooker.awk README.md
```

where

- `username/reponame` - the GitHub repository where README resides. This is needed to correctly rewrite relative links.
- `path/to/book_folder` (optional, default `./book`) - the output folder for generated markdown files.

### Step 2: run mdBook

```sh
mbdook build
```

### Step 3: deploy the website

The deployment of final html/js/css (as generated by the previous step) to the public web is out of scope of this article.

## Technical details

The project is implemented as a single-file [AWK script](https://github.com/xonixx/mdbooker/blob/main/mdbooker.awk) ([Wait... What?!](awk.md)).

This part can be of interest to those who would like to sharpen their AWK-fu a bit.

Before explaining some bits of my implementation let's come up with the requirements.

1. `SUMMARY.md` should be generated with a structure (nesting) determined by `## titles` in README.md.
2. README.md is split into separate .md-files named by titles.
3. Cross-README links are "fixed". In markdown you can reference any `## Section Title` by a `href="#section-title"`. This requires special handling. 
4. Relative links are "fixed". Since README.md resides in a repository it can reference any project file by its relative path. This requires special handling.
5. "Empty" sections should be filled by the list of links to their child sub-sections. This is needed when `## section` is immediately followed by `### sub-section` (So we want [this](https://makesure.dev/Directives.html) instead of [this](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_22.html)).   

Now let's take a look at how these requirements are implemented in code.

  
## Alternatives

The only alternative I've found is [Docsify](https://colinhacks.com/essays/docs-the-smart-way) -- small JS lib that renders your README.md as a single-page website. I didn't like it, though, because such single-pages usually give poor user experience.
