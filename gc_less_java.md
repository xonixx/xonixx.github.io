# GC-less (heap-less) Java

_TODO 2024_

## What

https://github.com/xonixx/gc_less - Experiments TODO

## Why

For fun and curiosity. 

Basically I wanted to check if the famous `sun.misc.Unsafe` approach is still viable with latest Java. 

Also, I wanted to try to program in Java like if I program in C and see how it goes.

## How
    
### sun.misc.Unsafe

### Epsilon GC

### Generating code by template

### Data structures implementation

### Benchmark

### Allocator + try-with-resources

### Ref
